<p>A set of reflection utilities and miscellaneous utilities related
to working with classes and their fields with no dependencies which is
compatible with java 1.5 and generics.</p>
<h2><a name="Features:" />Features:</h2>
<p>These are built to be compatible with <a
	href="http://commons.apache.org/beanutils/" rel="nofollow">Apache
Commons BeanUtils</a> and the nesting structure works the same, refer to the
apache BeanUtils project docs for details. Support for Apache DynaClass
/ DynaBean is included. Current users of beanutils should be able to
drop in these utilities and gain the functionality with minimal code
changes.</p>
<p>Handles field operations for properties (getters and setters),
partial properties (only getter or only setter), and fields. This is
configurable to use the fields only, properties only, or the hybrid
approach (default). This improves upon the BeanUtils limitation of
handling only properties or the Google utilities limitation of handling
only fields.</p>
<p>Getting and setting fields supports simple, nested, indexed, and
mapped values
<ul>
	<li><strong>Simple:</strong> Get/set a field in a bean (or map),
	Example: &quot;title&quot;, &quot;id&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Nested:</strong> Get/set a field in a bean which is
	contained in another bean, Example: &quot;someBean.title&quot;,
	&quot;someBean.id&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Indexed:</strong> Get/set a list/array item by index
	in a bean, Example: &quot;myList1&quot;, &quot;anArray2&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Mapped:</strong> Get/set a map entry by key in a bean,
	Example: &quot;myMap(key)&quot;, &quot;someMap(thing)&quot;</li>
</ul>
